# LightSpeed Pull Request (PR) Creation Guide

This guide explains how to create actionable, well-labeled pull requests (PRs) in LightSpeed projects—ensuring automation, traceability, and contributor clarity. Following these steps helps maintain quality and makes the review and release process efficient for everyone.

---

## 1. **Before You Open a PR**

- **Ensure your changes are linked to an actionable issue.**  
  Reference the related issue number in your PR description (e.g., “Closes #123”).
- **Rebase or update your branch to the latest `main` (or target) branch.**
- **Run all tests and linting locally.**  
  See [Testing Guide](TESTING.md).
- **Update documentation as needed.**  
  If you’ve changed behaviors or APIs, update relevant docs.

---

## 2. **Branch Naming**

Use a branch prefix that matches your change type:

- `feat/` for features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation
- `chore/` for chores and maintenance
- `refactor/`, `test/`, `perf/`, `ci/`, etc. as appropriate

Example:  
`feat/header-block-responsive-layout`

> **Tip:** Branch prefixes determine automation, label application, and PR template selection.

---

## 3. **Choose the Correct PR Template**

When you open a PR, GitHub will prompt you to pick a template matching your change:

- **Bugfix**
- **Feature**
- **Docs**
- **Chore**
- **Build/CI**
- **Hotfix**
- **Release**
- **Refactor**
- **General**

> Each template includes required fields and checklists. Fill these in thoroughly.

---

## 4. **Write a Clear PR Title**

Format:  
`[Type] Area/Component: Brief summary (Closes #issue)`

Examples:
- `[Feature] Block Patterns: Add new testimonial pattern (Closes #201)`
- `[Bugfix] Theme JSON: Fix color palette regression (Closes #198)`
- `[Docs] README: Add setup instructions`

---

## 5. **Complete the PR Description**

- **Describe what changed and why.**
- **Reference related issues** with `Closes #`, `Fixes #`, or `Related to #`.
- **Provide test instructions** (manual steps, screenshots, videos for UI changes).
- **List any skipped tests or known limitations.**
- **Note documentation updates** or required follow-up issues.

---

## 6. **Apply Labels and Milestones**

- Labels are set automatically based on branch prefix and file changes, but review and add as needed:
    - **Type:** `type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:docs`, etc.
    - **Area/Component:** `area:ci`, `comp:block-editor`, etc.
    - **Status:** `status:needs-review`, `status:needs-qa`, etc.
    - **Release:** `release:minor`, `release:patch`, `release:major`, etc.
    - **Meta:** `meta:needs-changelog`, `contrib:help-wanted`, etc.

- **Assign to the relevant milestone** (e.g., "Phase 6 - GC & Production") and project board if applicable.

---

## 7. **Check PR Checklist**

Each PR template includes a checklist. Ensure you:

- [ ] Ran all tests and linters
- [ ] Updated documentation (if needed)
- [ ] Added/updated tests
- [ ] Linked issues
- [ ] Provided screenshots or video (for UI changes)
- [ ] Selected appropriate labels
- [ ] Ensured CI passes

---

## 8. **Submit and Respond to Review**

- Open the PR and monitor CI status checks.
- **Respond promptly to reviewer feedback.**
- Make changes via additional commits; avoid force-push unless requested.
- **Update your PR description or checklist** if necessary.

---

## 9. **Merging and Release**

- Only maintainers can merge.
- PRs are merged after:
    - All status checks pass (tests, lint, a11y, etc.)
    - At least one reviewer approves
    - Changelog/release labels are set and docs/tests are updated
- PRs linked to issues with `Closes #issue` will auto-close the issue upon merge.

---

## 10. **Release Notes and Changelog**

- PRs affecting user-facing features or fixes must include a [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) entry.
- Label with `meta:needs-changelog` if your PR should be included in release notes.
- Release workflow will group and publish notes based on labels and PR templates.
