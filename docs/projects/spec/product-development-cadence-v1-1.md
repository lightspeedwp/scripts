# Product Development — Cadence

**Date:** 13-10-2025 — **Version:** v1.1

> Release‑train rhythm: predictable minors monthly; patches as needed. Uses the saved **Views** and **Automations** docs.

## Purpose

Ship product increments on a regular train (**vX.Y.Z**), with tight QA, changelogs, and clear decision points.

## Monthly release train

- **Week 1 — Scope & Plan**
  - Set Milestone **vX.Y.0**; select Features/Stories; create **Release Gate — vX.Y.Z** view.
- **Week 2–3 — Build**
  - Drive via **Board (by Assignee)**; prioritise **P1/P0**; keep PRs small and linked.
- **Week 4 — Freeze & Cut**
  - **Code freeze (24–48h)**; **QA Gate** on RC; **Release PR → main**; **tag** and publish notes.

## Weekly rhythm (Mon–Fri)

- **Mon — Planning & Intake (45m)**: prune **Backlog (Priority)**; ensure **Milestone** on in‑scope items.
- **Wed — Demo/Design review (30–45m)**: show increments; capture decisions; adjust scope.
- **Fri — Readiness (30m)**: check **Release Gate**, date risks (**Roadmap (Dates)**), and hotfixes.

## Hotfix lane

- Trigger: **S0/S1** or severe regression on **Live**.
- Flow: `hotfix/<slug>` → fast QA on **Staging** → tag **PATCH** → back‑merge to `develop` and open **Follow‑ups**.
- View: **Hotfix Lane** (Release type = Hotfix OR Severity in S0/S1).

## SLAs (target)

- **S0 – Blocker:** immediate hotfix; owner + deputy online until resolved.
- **S1 – Critical:** within 24h, or escalate to hotfix.
- **S2 – Major:** in current/next train.
- **S3 – Minor:** schedule; batch in a patch.
- **S4 – Trivial:** backlog with theme labels.
