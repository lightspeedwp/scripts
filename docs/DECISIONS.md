This document tracks key architectural and technical decisions made in LightSpeed projects. Each decision includes a short summary, rationale, and a link to a detailed ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in `docs/ADR/` where available.

Use this record to understand "why" major choices were made, avoid redundant debates, and onboard new contributors quickly.  
For new decisions, add a summary here and create a corresponding ADR file with full context.

## Decision Format

Each entry should include:

- **Decision N:** Clear one-line summary ([ADR-00N](ADR/ADR-00N-topic.md))
    - **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
    - **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
    - **Context:** Brief summary of why this decision was made, what alternatives were considered, and what it impacts.
    - **Consequences:** What this changes, who is affected, migration steps if any.

Example:
```markdown
- **Decision 6:** Switch CSS linter from stylelint to custom WordPress-tailored stylelint config ([ADR-006](ADR/ADR-006-stylelint.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-20
    - **Context:** Needed stricter enforcement of WordPress CSS naming and specificity rules; considered using Prettier only.
    - **Consequences:** All contributors must update their local configs. CI scripts updated, docs revised.
```

## Current Decisions

- **Decision 1:** Adopted native WordPress block patterns for all new theme development ([ADR-001](ADR/ADR-001-block-patterns.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-12
    - **Context:** Aligns with WordPress core, improves maintainability, reduces custom code.
    - **Consequences:** All new themes must use block patterns; legacy support documented in ADR.

- **Decision 2:** Standardized on PHP 8.2 for all CI and production environments ([ADR-002](ADR/ADR-002-php-version.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-13
    - **Context:** Needed features and performance from PHP 8.2. Dropped support for older versions.
    - **Consequences:** CI updated, composer.json set to >=8.2, migration steps in ADR.

- **Decision 3:** Use Playwright for E2E and accessibility testing ([ADR-003](ADR/ADR-003-playwright-testing.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-14
    - **Context:** Playwright supports multi-browser E2E and a11y checks. Considered Cypress, Selenium.
    - **Consequences:** New E2E tests in Playwright, contributors must install Playwright, CI setup described in ADR.

- **Decision 4:** All custom post types registered via `theme.json` wherever possible ([ADR-004](ADR/ADR-004-cpt-in-theme-json.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-15
    - **Context:** Unifies CPTs across themes and plugins, simplifies migrations.
    - **Consequences:** CPT registration functions deprecated, docs and onboarding updated.

- **Decision 5:** All client-facing code must pass Lighthouse a11y checks in CI ([ADR-005](ADR/ADR-005-accessibility-audit.md))
    - **Status:** Accepted
    - **Date:** 2025-10-16
    - **Context:** Accessibility is a core requirement; automating checks avoids regressions.
    - **Consequences:** PRs failing a11y in Lighthouse cannot be merged; CI config in ADR.
